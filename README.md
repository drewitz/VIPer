VIPer - Visualiser of Isometries in the Plane of hypERbolic geometry
====================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

VIPer can draw tesselations of the hyperbolic plane in the disc or upper half
space model. It either just draws the tesselation or animates certain elliptic,
parabolic or loxodromic isometries. It can also draw the tesselation for the
principal congruence subgroup of level 2 of the modular group.

TODO/IDEAS
----------

 - implement different tilings
 - implement more flexibility for the isometries
 - draw other subgroup tesselations
 - draw the dirichlet domain for a group given by generators (branch dirichlet)
